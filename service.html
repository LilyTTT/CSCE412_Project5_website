  <h1 class="subtitle-txt text">What is Service to Me?</h1>
  <p class="paragraph-txt text">Service is a crucial aspect of a community as it creates a sense of unity and interconnectedness. I enjoy helping others in areas I’m confident and capable about, and I don’t hesitate to reach out to others for support when I’m in need: acts of service strengthens the connection between individuals, as well as fostering a supportive environment in a community. 
    I give back to my community by working as a Peer Tutor for the College of Engineering. As a PT for freshmen engineering classes like ENGR102 (Introduction to Programming - Python), I get to work closely with new freshmen in the fall and do my best to help them succeed in the course as well as make a smooth transition into being an engineering student.  
    The most fulfilling part of the experience is seeing students with no previous experience grow throughout the semester as programmers. Because ENGR102 was my first programming class as well, I feel especially proud when new programmers succeed in the course through hard work.

      <p class="paragraph-txt text">The responsibilities of being a <b>Peer Tutor</b> for the first-year engineering program includes going to lectures/leading labs, holding office hours, and grading assignments. I get to work closely with students, other PTs, and professors during work time: I’ve met lots of cool people being a PT! Teaching/tutoring materials also helped me reinforce my foundational knowledge in programming and physics, I really enjoy my experience as a PT overall!</p>

We hope to foster an efficient and effective learning environment for first-year engineering students. The organization’s main presence is through a discord server with students, PTs, and even professors; there are currently over 4000 people in the server!</p>
